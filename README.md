## What is Zesty UX?

Zesty UX is a CSS framework inspired from [Skeleton](https://getskeleton.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

The goals of Zesty UX's CSS Framework are:

- Keep the baseline styling simple.
- 12-column responsive grid framework that's familiar.
- Add essentials as needed.

## Why is Zesty UX awesome?

Zesty UX is lightweight and provides the essentials. It mainly stlyes raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a 12-columns responsive grid.

- Around 800 lines of CSS code
- Baseline CSS framework, guide from the starting point
- Vanilla CSS and JavaScript, no compiling or installation needed
